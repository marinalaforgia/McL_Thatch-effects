Thatch effects on forb functional strategies

## Abstract

Invasive species act as a filter on the native community leading to shifts in species composition by selectively affecting species with specific competitive and stress tolerances. While many invaders display traits associated with high resource acquisition and fast growth, native plants in variable environments either focus on fast growth during high resource availability to avoid stress (“stress avoiders”) or slow growth during resource poor conditions to tolerate stress (“stress tolerators”). While the majority of research focuses on competitive effects between live plants, invasive species also alter communities through their production of light-limiting litter, the selective effects of which are little known. We manipulated the presence of fast-growing invasive annual grass and its litter in 30 subplots in an annual grassland and followed the demography of six native annual forb species that varied in their stress response strategy to understand how the presence of litter altered the differential effects of this invader. While live grass competition alone marginally decreased per capita growth rates of stress avoiders and had no effect on stress tolerators, the presence of litter led to declines in both types of forbs, but with stronger declines in avoiders through differential effects on seed set and germination. By altering the availability of light, invaders can turn a favorable environment into an unfavorable one, limiting the capacity of both avoiders and tolerators to increase under high resource conditions, but with stronger effects on resource sensitive avoiders.

## Data & Analysis

The script used to generate the project's analysis is titled "Thatch-proj.R" and found in the "Scripts" folder. To run this script, the following post-processing data files are needed:

* __grass-cover.csv__: data on grass cover per subplot; not ultimately used
* __Marina-Treatment-30.csv__: experimental design
* __dem-data-17.csv__: census data from 2017
* __final-flo-seed.csv__: seed set and flowering data, both years
* __seed-carryover-plot.csv__: seed bag data, both years
* __final-traits-w.csv__: trait data

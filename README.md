Thatch effects on forb functional strategies

## Abstract

Invasive species act as a filter on the native community, leading to shifts in species composition by selectively affecting species with specific functional strategies. Many invaders display traits associated with high resource acquisition and fast growth, but native plants in variable environments tend to adopt one of two strategies: fast growth during high resource availability to avoid stress (resource acquisitive) or slow growth during resource poor conditions to tolerate stress (resource conservative). The majority of research to date has focused on competitive effects among live plants, but many invasive species also alter communities through their production of litter. How this litter shifts the functional composition of communities remains unknown however. To understand these effects, I manipulated the presence of invasive annual grasses and their litter during a wet year in an annual grassland and followed the demographic rates of six native annual forb species that varied in their resource acquisition strategy. I found that live grass competition alone marginally decreased per capita growth rates of resource-acquisitive natives and had no effect on resource-conservative natives. The addition of litter, however, led to declines in both types of natives, with substantially stronger declines in resource-acquisitive natives through differential effects on seed set and germination. In this grassland, invaders turn a favorable environment into an unfavorable one through the production of litter, limiting the capacity of both resource-acquisitive and resource-conservative natives to maintain population growth under high resource conditions, but with stronger effects on acquisitive natives. This study demonstrates that invasive plants have the potential to dramatically shift the functional composition of native communities not just through live competition, but also through lagged effects of litter.

## Data & Analysis

The script used to generate the project's analysis is titled "Thatch-proj.R" and found in the "Scripts" folder. To run this script, the following post-processing data files are needed:

* __grass-cover.csv__: data on grass cover per subplot; not ultimately used
* __Marina-Treatment-30.csv__: experimental design
* __dem-data-17.csv__: census data from 2017
* __final-flo-seed.csv__: seed set and flowering data, both years
* __seed-carryover-plot.csv__: seed bag data, both years
* __final-traits-w.csv__: trait data
